    "I tackled this project so I could strengthen my front-end fundamentals using only vanilla JavaScript, HTML, and CSS. The goal was to " +
    "create a mobile-friendly tool that works seamlessly across devices, without relying on additional libraries or frameworks.",
    tech: "My main focus was on mobile responsiveness and ensuring smooth interaction for both desktop and mobile users. I paid "
    + "particular attention to how input fields and buttons behave across platforms, and used Firefox Developer Tools extensively "
    + "to preview and test the UI on different screen sizes. This allowed me to experiment with styles and layouts without "
    + "needing to constantly change the codebase.",
    tech2: "This project was also a great refresher on integrating JavaScript into "
    + "static HTML, especially around dynamic error handling. Validating user input and displaying contextual error messages helped " 
    + "sharpen my practical JavaScript skills and emphasized clean, user-friendly UX design.",

    desc: "This is a personality quiz with a narrative twist: instead of revealing something about the user," +
    " the results uncover the story of a fallen adventurer they're assigned to. Inspired by choose-your-own-adventure books, "
    +"the quiz places the user in the final moments of a character who's losing their battle against the final boss. As the "
    +"journey unfolds, the user will relive memories, reflect on their past, and experience final thoughts of a character on their deathbed. ",
    tech: "This was my first personal project using React, built from the ground up with Vite. After studying the React documentation, "
    + "I wanted a project that would help me get hands-on experience with state management and conditional rendering. A quiz format " 
    + " was the perfect playground for that.",
    tech2: "As a Dungeons and Dragons fan and the fantasy genre, I wanted to explore death not as a game mechanic, but a narrative moment. "
    + "The play style of a lot of tabletop role-playing games doesn't allow for deaths to happen with much emotional weight. "
    + "The project allowed me to explore what these final moments might look like, and give some depth to the experience.",
